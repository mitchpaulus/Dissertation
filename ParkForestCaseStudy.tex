\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\MakeUppercase{Park Forest Case Study}}{Park Forest Case Study}}

The last two cases studies were two other buildings that had data
available in Implementer and had discharge air temperature sensors for
the terminal units. The last two case studies were not studied in as
much detail as the NCTM building because of issues regarding data
quality.

Park Forest Branch Library is a one-story building with
\SI{10894}{\feet\squared} of gross floor area. The Park Forest Branch
Library consists of an open-space reading room and circulation, staff
area, and a meeting room. 

The following description comes from a Continuous
Commissioning\textsuperscript{\textregistered{}} report done on the Park
Forest building \cite{ParkForestReport}. The air-handling unit (AHU)
consists of a supply fan equipped with variable speed drive (VSD),
cooling coil, and outside air damper. The VSD for the supply air fan is
controlled to maintain the duct static pressure at the setpoint. The
schematic of this AHU can be seen in the BAS graphics as in \figref{}
\ref{fig:ParkForestAHUGraphic}, but actual installation is quite
different. There is no return air duct directly connected to the AHU,
possibly due to the space limitation. Instead, a mixed air chamber for
the AHU is installed on the rooftop as shown in \figref{}
\ref{fig:ParkForestMixedAirChamber}. The return air is taken from a
building exhaust chimney, and the outside air damper is installed on
this rooftop assembly. There is no return air damper installed,
although control drawings and the sequence show a BAS controlled RA
damper. The outside air  damper is commanded to be at a minimum
position of 25\% during normal operation. The sequence of operation
states that the outdoor air damper is controlled for economizer operation when
outside air conditions allow free cooling, but without a return air
damper, the controllability of the outdoor air flow is questionable.

\tableref{} \ref{tab:ParkForestTerminalUnitSpecs} shows the
mechanical specifications that were available for the terminal units at
Park Forest. By the specification, the minimum flow rates were set to
30\% for every terminal unit. 

However, based on the actual data for the building, the 30\% minimum
flow rates do not appear to hold. The measurements of the terminal
box flow were aggregated over a period from 10/23/2015 - 10/22/2016
(365 days) as shown in \tableref{}
\ref{tab:ParkForestMeasuredTerminalUnitFlow}. 

None of the terminal units reached the specified design value. The
5\textsuperscript{th} percentile was less than the specified minimum for
all 6 terminal units. This leads one to question the validity of the
air flow measurements.

Overall, this building was an example of one in which the quality of the
information related to the equipment and the quality of the data was
too poor to confidently make models.
