\chapter{Park Forest Case Study}

Park Forest Branch Library is a one-story building with
\SI{10894}{\feet\squared} of gross floor area. The Park Forest Branch
Library consists of an open-space reading room and circulation, staff
area, and a meeting room.

The following description comes from a Continuous Commissioning report
done on the Park Forest building. The air-handling unit (AHU) consists
of a supply fan equipped with variable speed drive (VSD), cooling coil,
and outside air damper. The VSD for the supply air fan is controlled to
maintain the duct static pressure at the setpoint. The schematic of this AHU can
be seen in the BAS graphics as in \figref{}
\ref{fig:ParkForestAHUGraphic}, but actual installation is
quite different. There is no return air duct directly connected to the
AHU, possibly due to the space limitation. Instead, a mixed air chamber
for the AHU is installed on the rooftop as shown in \figref{}
\ref{fig:ParkForestMixedAirChamber}. The return
air is taken from a building exhaust chimney, and the outside air damper
is installed on this rooftop assembly. There is no return air (RA)
damper installed, although control drawings and the sequence of show a
BAS controlled RA damper. The outside air (OA) damper is commanded to be
a minimum position of 25\% during normal operation. The sequence of
operation states that the OA damper is controlled for economizer
operation when outside air conditions allows free cooling, but without
RA damper, the controllability of the OA flow is questionable.
