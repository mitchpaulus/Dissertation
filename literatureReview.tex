\chapter{\uppercase {Literature Review}}


A significant amount of research has been completed in the field of control optimization schemes. Several different approaches including direct search methods, non-linear programming, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks have been suggested. Optimizations have been completed at all levels of the HVAC system: Zone, AHU, and Plant.  

When discussing optimization, it is important to be clear on what is meant by \textit{Controls Optimization}. When discussing the subject with a controls engineer, they will likely be analyzing parameters such as the settling time, overshoot, and rise time --- dynamic parameters. This research is focused more on the optimization of the \textit{steady-state} behavior of the system.

\section{Setpoint Optimization}

Since the time constant of AHU dynamics is on the order of minutes and the time constant of the thermal loads on the building are on the order of minutes to hours, it is appropriate to focus on the steady state behavior of AHUs \cite{Bourdouxhe1998ReferenceEquipment}.

Ke and Mumma were one of the first to attempt to balance the benefits of raising the supply air temperature with the penalties associated with increased fan energy and decreased dehumidification potential \cite{Ke1997OptimizedSystems}. This paper was limited in the fact that it made no discussion on actual implementation. The simulated results showed that optimizing the balance between fan, cooling, and reheat energy resulted in approximately 6\% energy savings annually versus a fixed supply air temperature setpoint. They showed that the benefit was most promising in the more temperate weather, when the VAV system was not running at minimum primary airflow. The proposed work would not only be optimizing the SAT, but also the fan static pressure setpoint.   

Wang and Song also balanced supply air temperature with fan power and included economizer control \cite{Wang2012AirCycles}. They found energy savings reaching up to 90\% under the specific outdoor air conditions and space loads in their simulation. The universal control sequence they proposed relied on an outside air temperature sensor, supply air temperature sensor, and supply air flow sensor. A limitation of this work was the assumption that the terminal boxes did not have reheat. It is well known though that terminal box reheat energy can be a significant contributor to energy consumption and the reduction of reheat is often the source of significant energy and money savings in existing building commissioning.  

Qin completed a dissertation in 2014 entitled, ``A Data-Driven Approach for System Approximation and Set Point Optimization, With a Focus in HVAC Systems'' \cite{Qin_2014_Res_Letters}. The focus of this work was related to the programming of thermostats in residential homes and did not cover any buildings in the commercial sector. The control responses for the rooms were being optimized and not the temperature set points of the rooms.  

Huh and Brandemuehl optimized the setpoint for hot and humid climates \cite{Huh2008}. The most significant limitation of this work was that it was heavily focused on a DX unit that would be common to a retail or supermarket and was also focused on only a hot and humid climate. Engdahl and Johansson also devoted investigation into the optimization of the supply air temperature setpoint in a VAV system \cite{Engdahl2004}, but only studied AHUs with 100\% outside air. 

While the focus of this proposal is on air handling units, the research regarding the optimization of central plants should not be ignored \cite{Ahn2001, Yu2008OptimizingChillers}. At the plant level, Braun has completed a great deal of research \cite{braun1990, Braun2007RP1252, Braun2007HybridCooling, Braun2007GeneralControl}. He has investigated other optimizations, such as ones for night precooling with packaged rooftop systems \cite{Braun2005}. Crowther and Furlong showed that advanced optimization controls for chiller-tower condenser-pump systems could make a 5-8\% improvement in annual energy use \cite{Crowther2004OptimizingTowers}. Henze has also been active in optimizing thermal storage systems \cite{Henze2005} along with Kintner-Meyer and Emery \cite{KintnerMeyer1995}. Lu et al. also focused on the optimization of the entire HVAC system, plant and building, in a series of papers. \cite{LuLu2004, LuLu2005Part1, LuLu2005Part2, LuLu2005HVACSystemOptimization}. 

United States patents have even been written on the topic of HVAC optimization. Cascia has a patent on optimal control for a cooling and heating plant with DDC control \cite{Cascia1999} and Seem has a patent that describes the strategy to optimally control an air side economizer \cite{Seem2002}. 

Numerous other researchers have thoroughly covered many aspects of an optimally operating HVAC system, which is not limited to \cite{Gruber2014AlternativeBuildings,Cho2009Single-ductOptimization,Nassif2005,Zaheer-uddin2000OptimalBuildings,Wang2000Model-basedAlgorithm,Henze2003EvaluationSystems,Liu2006ExperimentalFoundation, Zheng1996, Ning2010Neuro-optimalSystem,Atthajariyakul2004,Cui2004,XuXinhua2009,SunZhongwei2011,Mumma1997EnergyControl,Mossolly-Ghali-Ghaddar_2009_Energy}. Wang and Ma provided a comprehensive review of supervisory control research \cite{Wang2008SupervisoryReview}. This literature is limited in regards to efficient methods of rapid implementation. The proposed research also presents a different optimization methodology that focuses on the use BAS trend data paired with small, calibrated, first-principle models.

% \section{AHU Setpoint/Control Strategy Optimization}

% Mumma has also optimized the ventilation control in a variable air volume system \cite{}.


% Mossolly, Ghali, and Ghaddar examined advanced control strategies based on comfort and indoor air quality \cite{}. One proposed strategy explored adjusting the fresh air rate and the supply air temperature, maintaining a temperature set point in the zones and assuring indoor air quality. The second strategy also controlled the fresh air rate and supply air temperature but attempting to maintain thermal comfort based on the predicted mean vote of the zone. They found that they saved 30.4\% in operational costs based on simulations of a building in Beriut during the cooling summer season of 4 months with the control strategy based on the predicted mean vote.

% The work by Mossolly is an example of an advanced, optimized control strategy that does not make much mention of the feasibility of implementation. The strategy is limited by the number of weighting factors in the objective function, and the use of sometimes unreliable \(\text{CO}_{2}\) sensors for indication of demand. 


% Many of these approaches have significant limitations making them difficult to implement and scale. Some of the model-based optimizations include parameters unavailable in typical building BAS systems and the uncertainty in these parameters can be significant. Model specification would be necessary for each building setup, requiring significant engineering work. 

% It is desired to eliminate these limitations by developing a method that focuses only on the most robust sensors typical in a CAV/VAV reheat system, uses simple engineering formulas, and requires very little engineering setup. 
% The optimization literature focuses heavily on the methods and less on the implementation. This work would investigate how a centralized, protected, high-level optimized control program could be used and scaled to numerous buildings that each may have different control vendor programs.

\section{BAS Communication}

There are many different networking and communication levels and protocols related to buildings. Kastner, Neugschwandtner, and Soucek et al. provided a summary of the different systems that exist in buildings \cite{Kastner2005}. An understanding of the different levels (described as management, automation, and field by \cite{Kastner2005}) is important for developing any automated system. The most important open systems related to building automation include BACnet, LonWorks, EIB/KNX. Other important and relative standards, protocols, and technologies are shown in Table \ref{tab:CommunicationProtocols}.

At a more abstract level than BACnet, LonWorks, and EIB/KNX, Project Haystack is an important open source initiative that is looking to bring specific naming conventions to building operational data (project-haystack.org). Before data from sensors in buildings can be used effectively, an ``association''  of the data to an HVAC object (say data being associated with an air temperature sensor located in a specific air handling unit) needs to occur. In order to create an environment where an intelligent building makes sense, raw numeric data needs to have extensive meta-data to give it context. This can be related to engineering units, what piece of equipment the data belongs to, the hierarchy of equipment and relationships to one another, and other modifiers.

\section{Summary of Literature}

Not surprisingly, the goal of any controlled system is to operate optimally. It is to be  expected that there would be a wealth of literature on the optimization of all different components in a particular HVAC system. Any optimization problem has objectives and constraints. Many different objective functions and constraints to optimization problems in HVAC have been proposed. Numerous different optimization techniques and methods have been implemented and analyzed by different researchers. 

However, there are several limitations and deficiencies in the optimization literature. Not all authors have focused on the scalability of different optimization methodologies. Presently it is not feasible to implement complicated data-mining algorithms on every individual BAS or controller, partly due to installation time and partly due to the lack of facilities managers that have the necessary training to understand the algorithms and that can keep the system running properly. Facility managers already have difficulties in maintaining the most basic HVAC systems. 

Many of the techniques proposed in the literature also are dependent on sensors or information that are currently unavailable in typical commercial HVAC set-ups. For large-scale implementation, a methodology must use the minimum number of trends to complete useful optimization.

For an individual system, there are more than enough well documented and effective optimization methods and algorithms. Yet very few buildings in practice have these optimizations in place because the other numerous challenges have not been fully solved. These challenges include complexity in implementing with different BAS vendors, training a staff to understand the logic behind the optimizations, and simply the technician effort to install and setup implementations.

This research proposes its own intuitive optimization method based on small first-principle models using historical data to calibrate that is designed to efficient in scaling. The research investigates how to use current communication protocols with BAS systems and implementable methodologies to apply a single set of optimization logic and code to many and varied air handling units.
