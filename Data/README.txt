2017-06-07-TplenUnc.csv holds the uncertainty in the plenum temperature
as a function of fraction of primary flow. The uncertainty in the
temperature measurements was assumed to be 1 degree F and the percent
uncertainty in the flow measurements was taken to be 10%. The different
Delta T's (Difference between the discharge air temperature and the
primary flow temperature) are the series.
