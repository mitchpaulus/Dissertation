\section{Logistic Form of the Ramp Function. }

The threshold function is the derivative of the ramp function. The
threhsodl function can be approximatled arbitrarily well using the
logistic function. The logistic function has the from
\begin{equation}
    y=\frac{L}{1-e^{k\left(x-x_{0}\right)}}
\end{equation}
