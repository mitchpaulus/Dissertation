Notes from editing with Claridge marked up
==========================================

Page 12, question on why this is the most robust? It would be in the
context of no other additional information. 

Page 29, discussion on better terms for "children" terminal units. 

Page 35, used the term "data dump" 

[Data dump](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/95562/alternatives-to-the-noun-dump-as-in-a-data-dump)

Page 39, I attempted to remove the word "container" where possible.


Page 58, it is mentioned that the data is plotted. This was completed
with the Batch Plotter and could all be added. Do we want to do this?

Page 66, I don't really have any explanation for that plot. 


Page 67, Figure 5.21, which shows FPVAV-2-14, it is difficult to
determine whether this zone should be considered interior or exterior. 

Page 71, the "crossover" points are going to be different because the
absolute zone load is going to be very different for the different
units. 

Removed all uses of the term "children" terminal units, etc. Would
rather not have to define it. 

The reason that Park Forest and Preston Royal cannot be used is that the
data is coming in repeated as a constant the majority of the time.

### Flow data
FPB-01 -- Does not have data. 
FPB-02 -- Data seems to be working. 
FPB-03 -- Is constant or zero.
FPB-04 -- Working
FPB-05 -- Constant at 0
FPB-06 -- Working 
FPB-07 -- Working
FPB-08 -- Working
FPB-09 -- Working
FPB-10 -- Not available. 
FPB-11 -- Is constant or zero
FPB-12 -- Working
FPB-13 -- Stretches of constant data
FPB-14 -- Stretches of constant data
FPB-15 -- Stretches of constant data

Less than half the boxes appear to be trending correctly. 

FPB-05 appears to have constant flow of 0.

FPB-11 and FPB-03 also are 0 for many timestamps.
