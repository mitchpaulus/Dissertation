\indent  In this work, a new paradigm for the optimization of air
handling unit systems in buildings was explored. The methods assume
that only commonly trended sensor data would be available, and that no
live connection to trend values existed. An actual implementation would
only require a small script to be written at the target building to
request information from a centralized server. 

A prioritization of sensors to trend at buildings is presented.
Investigations in the methodology possibilities were completed on a case study
building on the Texas A\&M campus, the National Center for Therapeutic
Medicine (NCTM). The algorithms and models for the optimization are
presented, along with uncertainty analysis into several key model
parameters. 

Approximately 23-29\% energy savings were found for AHU-2-3 at the NCTM
building.  Missing fan power and air flow sensors were a significant determent to
the method. Lack of easily accessible, accurate, manufacturers
specifications were also limitations.
