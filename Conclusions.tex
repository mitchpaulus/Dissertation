\chapter{\MakeUppercase{Conclusions}} 

The following conclusions can be derived from this work.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item At the current time, missing sensors and sensor uncertainty 
        reduces the potential effectiveness of an approach described.
    \item The mixed air temperature can be predicted to within X
    \item With no plenum temperature sensor, for terminal units that
        bring in plenum air, it was not possible to predict the plenum
        temperature in a useful manner. Assuming a constant value or the
        temperature of the corresponding space were not acceptable for
        this work with regards to estimating the reheat at the terminal units.
    \item The estimated zone load based on terminal unit flow and
        discharge temperature will depend on the sensitivity of the
        controls at the terminal unit. Hunting is present, which makes
        it difficult to gauge what the true zone load in the space is. 
    \item Setup in the prototype approach is fast and extensible to
        future buildings and system types. 
    \item Certain sensors should be prioritized over others. Suggestions
        are given in Section \ref{sec:Prioritization}. 
    \item The difference between the maximum measured flow and the design flow
        from the terminal units was under \SI{200}{\CFM} for all but one
        terminal unit. 
    \item Savings are highly dependent on the current operation. For two
        of the second floor air handlers in the NCTM building, no
        savings were to be found. However, in AHU-2-3, over 20\% energy
        savings were possible.
